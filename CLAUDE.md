# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Vite)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint code linting
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Architecture Overview

This is a single-page React application for guitar chord and scale visualization built with modern web technologies. The project is currently undergoing **TypeScript conversion** and has been **refactored from a single-file architecture** into a well-organized modular structure.

### Current Architecture Status

**Main Application Flow:**
- `src/main.jsx` → `src/App.jsx` → `AppContent` component
- **Fully consolidated architecture** - all app logic directly in App.jsx (no container layer)
- Context providers for comprehensive state management with **no prop drilling**
- **Mixed TypeScript/JavaScript codebase** (TypeScript conversion in progress)

### TypeScript Migration Status

**Converted to TypeScript (16 files):**
- All services, types, constants, contexts, and hooks
- Comprehensive type system with strict configuration
- Type-safe music theory calculations and guitar logic

**Remaining JavaScript (8 files):**
- Components still in JSX but consuming TypeScript types
- Main containers and UI components

### Technology Stack

- **React 19.1.0** with modern hooks patterns
- **TypeScript 5.8.3** with strict configuration
- **Vite 6.3.5** for build tooling and development server
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.10** with the new `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- **ESLint 9.25.0** with flat config and React-specific rules
- **Node.js 22+** (specified in engines and .nvmrc)

### Key Architecture Components

**1. Context-Based State Management:**
- `GuitarContext`: Guitar state, fretboard logic, capo management
- `MusicalContext`: Note naming, key signatures, music theory
- `SettingsContext`: UI settings (theme, layout, preferences)
- `ThemeContext`: Theme computation and styling (replaces useTheme hook)
- **Zero prop drilling** - all components access contexts directly
- No external state management library needed

**2. MusicTheory Service (TypeScript):**
- Fully converted to TypeScript with comprehensive types
- Semitone-based note system (0-11 representing chromatic notes)
- Chord and scale generation using interval formulas
- Guitar tuning definitions and custom tuning support
- Note position finding on fretboard with capo support

**3. Interactive SVG Fretboard:**
- Pure SVG with mathematical positioning calculations
- Supports horizontal and vertical orientations
- Drag-and-drop capo with visual feedback
- Real-time note highlighting and interaction
- Responsive sizing based on layout preferences

**4. Theme and Settings System:**
- Dark/light/system theme detection via `useTheme` context hook
- Multiple layout sizes (compact/comfortable/spacious)
- Persistent user preferences via `useSettings` context hook
- Dynamic theme switching with context-aware styling
- **All theme logic consolidated in ThemeContext** (no separate useTheme hook file)

### Code Organization Patterns

**Component Structure:**
- Functional components with hooks throughout
- Extensive use of `useMemo` for performance optimization
- TypeScript types imported and used in JSX components
- SVG rendering with mathematical calculations for positioning

**State Management:**
- Context providers for shared state
- Custom hooks for domain-specific logic
- Derived state with `useMemo` for complex calculations
- Type-safe state updates and calculations

**Styling Approach:**
- Tailwind utility classes with conditional rendering
- Dynamic theme switching via computed class objects
- Responsive design with breakpoint-specific layouts
- Tailwind v4 with new Vite plugin (no separate config)

## Important Implementation Details

**Performance Considerations:**
- Heavy use of `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- SVG rendering optimized for interactive performance
- Theme calculations cached to prevent excessive re-renders
- Context providers minimize unnecessary re-renders

**Type Safety:**
- Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive types
- Type-safe music theory calculations
- Strongly typed guitar and UI state management
- Runtime type validation for critical calculations

**Fretboard Rendering:**
- Pure SVG with mathematical positioning calculations
- Coordinate system switches between horizontal/vertical orientations
- Capo logic includes string coverage and note greying
- Real-time drag interaction with mouse event handling

## Configuration Notes

**TypeScript Configuration:**
- Strict mode enabled with comprehensive type checking
- ES2020 target with modern module resolution
- Path mapping and barrel exports for clean imports

**ESLint Configuration:**
- Modern flat config format
- Allows unused variables with uppercase/underscore patterns
- React hooks rules enforced
- TypeScript-aware linting rules

**Build Configuration:**
- Standard Vite React + TypeScript setup
- Tailwind v4 with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- No custom build optimizations or aliases configured

## Current Development Status

**Recently Completed:**
- ✅ Consolidated GuitarVisualizerApp code directly into App.jsx (eliminated container layer)
- ✅ Removed containers directory
- ✅ Extracted components to separate TypeScript files (ModeSelector, MainControls, CustomTuningSelector, InputField)
- ✅ Converted extracted components to TypeScript with proper typing
- ✅ **Eliminated all prop drilling** - created SettingsContext and ThemeContext
- ✅ Consolidated useTheme hook into ThemeContext for cleaner architecture

**Next Steps:**
1. 🔄 Continue extracting remaining large components (ChordIdentifier, StatusPanel, CapoControls)
2. Complete TypeScript conversion of remaining components (Fretboard, etc.)
3. Create comprehensive shared types file
4. **TODO: Refactor InputField to be properly polymorphic** - currently uses non-elegant interface approach for min/max props

## Claude Code Instructions

**Memory Management:**
- **ALWAYS update this CLAUDE.md file before OR after completing any significant task**
- **Update project memory immediately if interrupted or if session crashes**
- Keep development status section current with ongoing work
- Document any architectural decisions or patterns discovered

**Git Commit Guidelines:**
- **NEVER add Claude as co-author when committing code**
- Use standard commit messages without Claude attribution
- **Keep commit messages simple and concise** - focus on major changes, avoid overly detailed explanations
- Create logical checkpoint commits during refactoring work

**Development Approach:**
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Follow established TypeScript patterns and type definitions
- **Avoid type casting (`as` keyword) as much as possible** - prefer proper type guards, narrowing, and strict typing
- **Use ComponentPropsWithRef/WithoutRef when creating component interfaces** - leverage React's built-in types instead of recreating HTML element props
- **Prefer Pick<Type, 'specific' | 'props'> over Partial<Type>** when you know exactly which properties a component needs - more precise and self-documenting
- Maintain existing performance optimizations (useMemo patterns)
- Run `npm run typecheck` after TypeScript changes
- Run `npm run lint` before committing changes

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
